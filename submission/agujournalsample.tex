\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Over the last two decades the paradigm in weather forecasting has
shifted from being deterministic to probabilistic \citep[see
e.g.][]{Palm00,Hami00}. Accordingly, numerical weather prediction
(NWP) models have been run increasingly as ensemble forecasting
systems. The goal of such ensemble forecasts is to approximate the
forecast probability distribution by a finite sample of scenarios
\citet{Leit74}\footnote{See \citet{Leit74} for a more in-depth
description of these issues and their complex implications.}
Global ensemble forecast systems, like the European
Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ensemble, are prone
to probabilistic biases, and are therefore not reliable. They
particularly tend to be underdispersive for surface weather parameters
\citet{Boug10, Park08}. In order to correct for forecast
underdispersion and bias in NWP ensembles different
statistical
post-processing methods have been developed, of which ensemble model
output statistics (EMOS) \citep{Gneit05} is among the most widely
applied. EMOS yields a parametric forecast distribution by linking its
parameters to ensemble statistics. Due to its simplicity and low
computational cost, we focus on EMOS for this study.



The ECMWF ensemble is under continuous development, and hence its
forecast skill improves over time \citep{Buiz98,Buiz07,Rich13,Haid14}.
Parts of these improvements may be due to a reduction of probabilistic
biases. From this we deduce the following hypothesis: As the raw
forecasts continuously improve, it is hypothesized that the gap in
skill between raw ensemble and post-processed forecasts narrows,
because systematic errors typically captured by post-processing are
reduced 
by those improvements. 
%%
%% Use \explain{} before change, so that it ends up on the right line.
\explain[Jon, 2/16/16]{Redundant sentence, better without it} 
\deleted{In other words, probabilistic biases,
which can be reduced by statistical post-processing methods, decrease
over time.}
Assuming that the raw ensemble forecasts continue to
improve in the future, the gap in skill may eventually be closed when
the raw ensemble forecasts become reliable and unbiased.  In this work
we analyse the evolution of the global performance of the operational
ECMWF raw ensemble and the corresponding post-processed EMOS forecasts
for 2 metre temperature (T2M), 24-hour precipitation (PPT24), and 10-m
wind speed (V10). We verify the forecasts against globally distributed
surface synoptic observations (SYNOP) data over a period of about 10
years. We firstly evaluate the monthly average skill in terms of CRPS
for both the raw and the EMOS forecasts. In order to assess the extent
to which the results depend on the choice of the post-processing
method, Bayesian model averaging (BMA), \citet{Raft05,Fra10} is
additionally applied to the T2M raw ensemble forecasts. We will use
the negatively oriented (i.e. the lower the value the higher the
skill) continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) \citep{Math76} as a
measure of skill. As the CRPS assesses both reliability and sharpness
and is a proper score \citep{Gneit07b}, we rely on it for model fitting
and verification throughout this study. Note that skill and
reliability are linked in that given constant sharpness an improvement
in reliability leads to an improvement in skill and vice versa. We
finally analyse the evolution of the gap in CRPS between raw ensemble
and post-processed forecasts.

After presenting the dataset in section~\ref{sec:intro} we summarize
the methods for post-processing and for the assessment of the global
skill evolution in section~\ref{sec:meth}. In section~\ref{sec:res}
the results are shown.  This is followed by a discussion in
section~\ref{sec:disc} along with some concluding
remarks. These
analyses have been performed using the statistical software \texttt{R}
\citep{R2013}.

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:meth}

\subsection{Post-processing Using EMOS}
Post-processing using EMOS converts a raw ensemble of discrete
forecasts into a probability distribution. Let $y$ be the variable to
be forecast (here: T2M, PPT24 or V10) and let ${f}=(f_{1}, f_{2},
\dots, f_{K})^{T}$ be the vector of the $K$ member raw ensemble
forecasts (here: HRES, ENS, and CTRL). Then the EMOS
\added{predictive}
density can be written as:
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}
y|{f} \sim g(m, \sigma),
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
where $g(\cdot)$ is a parametric density function with location and
scale parameters $m$ and $\sigma$, respectively, which depend on the
raw ensemble.

\subsubsection{Temperature}
For T2M forecasts $g(\cdot)$ is a normal density distribution with
mean $m$ and variance $\sigma^{2}$. Here, we use a variant of the
original EMOS approach similar to the one proposed by
\citet{ScheueBue13} where the departures of observed temperatures from
their climatological means are related to those of the forecasts.
Specifically, let $T=\{t_{1},\ldots,t_{n}\}$ be a training period of
$n$ days preceding the forecast initialization and denote by $f_{tk}$
the forecast of the k-th ensemble member and by $y_{t}$ the
observation on day $t\in T$. As a first step, we fit a regression
model
%%% \begin{linenomath*} ...\end{linenomath*} puts a line number in equation:
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}
y_{t_{j}} = c_{0} + c_{1}\sin\left(\frac{2\pi j}{365}\right) +
c_{2}\cos\left(\frac{2\pi j}{365}\right) + \varepsilon_{t_{j}}, \quad
j=1,\ldots,n
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
which captures the seasonal variation of T2M. The residual terms
$\varepsilon_{t_{j}}$ are likely correlated over time, but for
simplicity an ordinary least squares fit is performed. We denote by
$\tilde{y}_{t}$ the fitted value of this periodic regression model on
day $t$ and interpret it as the climatological mean temperature on
this day. This model can easily be extrapolated to future days
$t_{d+1}, t_{d+2}, \ldots$ The above regression includes both a sine
and a cosine term which is equivalent to a cosine model with variable
phase and amplitude. Since $j=1,\ldots,n$ is just a numbering of the
days in $T$, different training periods have different phase
parameters and hence $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ evolve over the calendar
year. We fit the same type of model also to the ensemble mean,
control, and high resolution run and obtain climatological means
$\tilde{f}_{\overline{\mathrm{ENS}},t}, \tilde{f}_{\mathrm{CTRL},t}$,
and $\tilde{f}_{\mathrm{HRES},t}$. The mean of the forecast
distribution is then:
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}
m = \tilde{y} + a_{1}(f_{\mathrm{HRES}} - \tilde{f}_{\mathrm{HRES}}) +
a_{2}(f_{\mathrm{CTRL}} - \tilde{f}_{\mathrm{CTRL}}) +
a_{3}(f_{\overline{\mathrm{ENS}}} -
\tilde{f}_{\overline{\mathrm{ENS}}}).
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
The variance of the forecast distribution is linked to the raw
ensemble by: 
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}
\sigma^{2} = b_{0} + b_{1}s^{2},
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
where $s^{2} = \frac{1}{K}\sum_{k=1}^{K}(f_{k} -
\frac{1}{K}\sum_{k=1}^{K}f_{k})^{2}$. The parameters
${\theta}_{T2M}=(a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, b_{0}, b_{1})^{T}$ are
constrained to be non-negative, and hence $a_{k}/\sum_{k=1}^{K} a_{k}$
can be understood as the weight of model $k$.

\subsubsection{Precipitation}
For PPT24 we use the EMOS approach proposed by \citet{Scheu14}, where
$g(\cdot)$ is a left-censored (at zero) generalized extreme value
(GEV) distribution. While the shape parameter $\xi$ of the GEV is kept
constant ($\xi=0.2$), the location and the scale parameters $m$ and
$\sigma$ are linked to the raw ensemble via:
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{eqnarray}
m &=& a_{0} + a_{1} f_{\mathrm{HRES}} + a_{2} f_{\mathrm{CTRL}} +
a_{3} f_{\overline{\mathrm{ENS}}} + a_{4} \pi_{0},\nonumber\\
\sigma &=& b_{0} + b_{1} \mathrm{MD}_{f},
\end{eqnarray}
\end{linenomath*}
where $\pi_{0}$ is the fraction of ensemble members predicting zero
precipitation and $\mathrm{MD}_{f}:= K^{-2}$\break
$\sum_{k, k' = 1}^{K} |
f_{k} - f_{k'} |$ is the ensemble mean difference. Again, the
parameters are denoted by $\theta_{PPT24}=(a_{0}, \dots, a_{4}, b_{0},
b_{1})^{T}$. The parameters $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, b_{0}, b_{1}$ are
constrained to be non-negative, and hence the normalized parameters
$a_{1}$ to $a_{3}$ can be understood as weights.

\subsection{Global CRPS Analysis}
 \label{sec:meth_glob_crps}

As stated in the introduction, the main objective of this study is to
analyse whether the gap in CRPS between the raw ensemble and the
post-processed forecast narrows over time. This is assessed
station-wise using both a parametric and a non-parametric approach.
For the former, we fit the following regression model to the monthly
time series of CRPS differences ($\Delta \mathrm{CRPS}_{t} =
\mathrm{CRPS}_{\mathrm{raw},t} - \mathrm{CRPS}_{\mathrm{EMOS}, t}$):
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}
\Delta \mathrm{CRPS}_{t} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} t + \beta_{2} \sin\left(\frac{2\pi t}{12}\right) + \beta_{3} \cos\left(\frac{2\pi t}{12} \right) + \epsilon, \phantom{bla} \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^{2}) \label{eq:linseas}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
where $\Delta \mathrm{CRPS}_{t}$ is the predictand, $t$ is now the
time in months, and $\sigma^{2}$ denotes the error variance. For the
latter, we use Kendall's $\tau$ correlation coefficient and the
associated test statistics \citep{Mann45} as implemented in the
\texttt{R} package \texttt{Kendall} \citep{Kendall}. In order to
correct for seasonal effects, we calculate the $\tau$ statistics using
the residuals of the following model:
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}
\Delta \mathrm{CRPS}_{t} = \gamma_{0} + \gamma_{1} \sin\left(\frac{2\pi t}{12}\right) + \gamma_{2} \cos\left(\frac{2\pi t}{12} \right) + \epsilon, \phantom{bla} \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^{2})
\label{eq:tauseas}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
Note that negative $\tau$ values indicate a negative trend and
positive values a positive one. Figure~\ref{figone} a) and b)
show the regression lines estimated by model (\ref{eq:linseas}) for
monthly averages of $\Delta \mathrm{CRPS}$ and the corresponding
Kendall's $\tau$ test statistics for an example with decreasing and
increasing gap.


\section{Results}
\label{sec:res}

\subsection{Are There Any Significant Temporal Trends?}


The above results indicate a tendency of a decrease in $\Delta$CRPS
over time at least for T2M and PPT24. In the following we check the
percentages of stations with decreasing, an absence of, or increasing
trend in $\Delta$CRPS over time at a significance level of 0.05. In
order to be more confident about the results this analysis is
performed using both the parametric regression model and the
non-parametric Kendall's $\tau$ correlation coefficient test. As
already mentioned both approaches correct for seasonal effects.
Furthermore, in case of T2M the same analysis has been performed
additionally using BMA instead of EMOS in order to relax the
dependence on one particular post-processing method. As shown in
Table~\ref{tab:signif_gap_clos} the stations with no significant trend
outnumber the stations with either negative or positive trend for all
three variables and lead times considered. Note that the percentage of
stations without any significant trend increases with increasing lead
time. In line with the results shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:mean_and_slope}, significantly negative trends are
more common than positive ones for T2M and PPT24. The difference
between the number of stations with negative and those with positive
trend reduces with increasing lead time, but is still greater than
zero for a 10 day forecast. Note that the high number of
non-significant stations in case of PPT24 is likely to be due to the
high variability of precipitation amounts, and hence variability of
CRPS values, which leads to a large residual standard error in case of
the parametric regression model and to a lot of pairs (a pair denotes
here a value of $\Delta$CRPS and its associated time stamp) opposite
to the estimated direction in case of the $\tau$ test statistics. In
case of V10 the stations with a negative trend and those with a
positive trend are almost equally frequent regardless of the lead
time. Figures of the global distributions of stations with no,
significantly negative, and significantly positive trend in
$\Delta$CRPS are available as supplemental material to this paper.


\section{Discussion and Conclusions}
\label{sec:disc}

According to the above analyses the gap in CRPS between the raw
ensemble and the EMOS forecasts remains almost constant over time. For
T2M and PPT24 $\Delta$CRPS shows a slightly decreasing tendency. The
higher the lead time the less accentuated is this tendency. For V10
such a tendency cannot be detected. The parametric regression model
and the non-parametric $\tau$ test yield similar results. Hence, a
linear model that is overlaid by seasonal fluctuations seems to be
reasonable. Note that the skill of the raw ensemble and the EMOS
forecasts may sometimes be negatively affected by upgrades to the
atmospheric model. Model upgrades may deteriorate raw ensemble skill
at some individual stations. For instance, a resolution increase may
introduce new issues with statistical downscaling of the forecasts to
some specific observation sites. But more importantly, the skill of
the post-pro\-cessed forecasts can be lowered dramatically if a model
update happens between the training and the verification period. These
issues may result in positive trends in $\Delta$CRPS. Ideally,
post-processing would be based on a cascade of reforecasts. That is,
for each atmospheric model version, training of the post-processing
model would be done using a corresponding time series of reforecasts
made with that same model version. Furthermore, the observations may
be affected by measurement errors. If these errors change over time,
they may also influence the estimates of the trends in $\Delta$CRPS.
As the problems introduced by statistical downscaling may be mitigated
by verifying against model analysis, a similar study that replaces
observations by model analysis, as proposed by \citet{Ghel00} and
\citet{Papp09}, may give further insights.

From the above we conclude that the probabilistic skill of both the
raw ensembles and the EMOS forecasts improves over time. The fact that
the gap in skill has remained almost \textbf{constant}, especially for
V10, suggests that improvements to the atmospheric model have an
effect quite different from what calibration by statistical
post-processing is doing. That is, they are increasing potential
skill. Thus this study indicates that (a) further model development is
important even if one is just interested in point forecasts, and (b)
statistical post-processing is important because it will keep adding
skill in the foreseeable future.

%
%  EQUATIONS
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% Single-line equations are centered.
% Equation arrays will appear left-aligned.

Math coded inside display math mode \[ ...\]
 will not be numbered, e.g.,:
 \[ x^2=y^2 + z^2\]

 Math coded inside \begin{equation} and \end{equation} will
 be automatically numbered, e.g.,:
 \begin{equation}
 x^2=y^2 + z^2
 \end{equation}


% To create multiline equations, use the
% \begin{eqnarray} and \end{eqnarray} environment
% as demonstrated below.
\begin{eqnarray}
  x_{1} & = & (x - x_{0}) \cos \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \sin \Theta  \nonumber \\
  y_{1} & = & -(x - x_{0}) \sin \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \cos \Theta.
\end{eqnarray}

%If you don't want an equation number, use the star form:
%\begin{eqnarray*}...\end{eqnarray*}

% Break each line at a sign of operation
% (+, -, etc.) if possible, with the sign of operation
% on the new line.

% Indent second and subsequent lines to align with
% the first character following the equal sign on the
% first line.

% Use an \hspace{} command to insert horizontal space
% into your equation if necessary. Place an appropriate
% unit of measure between the curly braces, e.g.
% \hspace{1in}; you may have to experiment to achieve
% the correct amount of space.

%
%  EQUATION NUMBERING: COUNTER
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% You may change equation numbering by resetting
% the equation counter or by explicitly numbering
% an equation.

% To explicitly number an equation, type \eqnum{}
% (with the desired number between the brackets)
% after the \begin{equation} or \begin{eqnarray}
% command.  The \eqnum{} command will affect only
% the equation it appears with; LaTeX will number
% any equations appearing later in the manuscript
% according to the equation counter.
%

% If you have a multiline equation that needs only
% one equation number, use a \nonumber command in
% front of the double backslashes (\\) as shown in
% the multiline equation above.

% If you are using line numbers, remember to surround
% equations with \begin{linenomath*}...\end{linenomath*}

%  To add line numbers to lines in equations:
%  \begin{linenomath*}
%  \begin{equation}
%  \end{equation}
%  \end{linenomath*}
